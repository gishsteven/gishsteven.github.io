The Breathalyzer Lockbox
This was a small project built with the Intel Edison (Computer-On-Module), an LCD Display, and an Alcohol Sensor. A servo was used for the locking mechanicasm. 

To interact with the device, the user would just blow into the breathalyzer. Any detection of alcohol would trigger the lockbox to stay locked for a certain period of time, depending on the blood alchohol content. If no alcohol was detected the box would unlock. 

The main idea for this project was for it to be used as a storage container to put away car keys when a guest is drinking at a party. 

The initial design was very tounge in cheek and honestly made a quirky party gift when the programming was reversed; if the alcohol content was detected above a certain level.. The box would unlock itself to reveal.. more alcohol!
