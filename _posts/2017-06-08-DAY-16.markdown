If I do not have time to make my bed, read literature, or journal an entry on a daily occurance; I am not in control.

I have shortly over two weeks worth of content to publish for my 90 Day Challenge.
This is Day 16 of the 90 Day Challenge, of which I'm supposed to log about my day to
help myself reinforce new habits, hobbies, and lifestyle. 

I've written (poorly) about my life on and off for the past nine (9) years with my haitus expanding every off season in duration. 
I've written to entertain others, to push myself to keep life a tad mildly more interesting, to document memories and experiences of the good and only the good. 
I've stopped because, well, I don't know. I just did. 

Today I worked the usual 9-to-5 job (actually 10a-to-6a and then 12p-2a; the former just sounds better). 
I'll try to keep work related business vague, and my logs more concise.

This afternoon marked my first crossfit gym session (after completing my fundamentals training).
Oh right, I've joined a Crossfit Gym for the summer. 
I am currently the youngest, smallest, and weakest of everyone I have met so far; I find this exciting and equally intimidating. 

Later in the evening I went to a new member orientation at the Tech Shop.
Oh right, I've joined a TechShop (DIY Workshop Community) for the summer.
I'm surrounded by a vast community of makers, and craftsmen. 
I registered for a few recommended workshops that will help me get into woodworking. 


I have a lot of on my plate for the summer, I haven't shaved since Day 0 (honestly that doesn't mean much with my asian stubble)
And even though life has been somewhat inconsistent lately; I like the direction I'm heading.
