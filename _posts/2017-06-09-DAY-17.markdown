Hm, I made a log for this date a while ago, it looks like I haven't saved it.

I had a long day at work.
I worked a short shift up to 2am and then came back later that morning to stay for another twelve (12) hours. 
If I were an iPhone I would be at 20% on low power mode. 

My day was made up for with a few hours of gaming with Gish followed up by ramen for dinner at 1:00am.

Keep yourself constantly exposed to new experiences, surround yourself with people who are smarter than you, who are masters at their craft.
