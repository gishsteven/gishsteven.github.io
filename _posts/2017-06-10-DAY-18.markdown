It's been a long day today, a wholesome one. 

I went to my workout class earlier this morning and I threw up right after the session was finished.
I felt great though; I wonder how far I can get in 90 days. 

The entire day I've been taking classes on how to use certain machines (CNC) and programs (Vcarve) for future woodworking projects. 
After six (6) hours of training and a short lunch break for chinese takeout I'm officially ready to make some neat bookcases and picture frames.

Oh yeah, when I was ordering for takeout I instantly felt something off about my order. 
The cashier gave me too much change, I basically had a free meal. 

The rest of my afternoon was spend holed up at work (it's a Saturday and I was nearby work, so I decided to go to work.)
For an introvert I had a great deal of human interaction the entire day, apparently my cubicle was the best place to recharge. 

I'll be going out again later tonight.

It's been a good day.
