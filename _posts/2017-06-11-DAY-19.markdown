Busy week for a free day.

I slept in this morning and fell into auto-pilot up until the afternoon.
I went out to to get Jollibee for myself, my girlfriend, and another friend I was supposed to meet up with three hours prior.
I had two meetings this afternoon, one for my Fraternity and one for my Senior Project group. 
Walked around downtown with a friend for a few hours and then I spent the rest of the evening with the girlfriend. 

It was a good day; I regret wasting my entire morning the way I did though.
Just a bad habit I easily fall into.
