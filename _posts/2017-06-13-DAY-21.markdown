Two things I want to improve indefinitely; self-control and punctuality. 

I slept in this morning because "one more game" never means what is actually done. 
My day fell a bit short because of that. 

Life is more wholesome when you live with intent. Punctuality is intent. 

Anyway; the past two days so far have been feeling stagnent. 
I haven't made time to plan out my week or personal life; I'm also stuck on assignments that I feel (and everyone else) are rudimentary.

I want to go to bed early tonight.
