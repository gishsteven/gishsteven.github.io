Missing personal deadlines.
Sleeping In. 

I haven't started on any personal projects yet, I'm behind on where I need to be for my senior project. 
I usually burn out once it starts getting late in the afternoon and my peak hours get filled with distractions.
It's also hot. 

I can work endlessly when it's doing something I love. 
I lose track of time when I'm in the workflow.
But I also lose track of time when I'm out of it. 

I have habits that I am aware of but I don't remind myself daily enough.
