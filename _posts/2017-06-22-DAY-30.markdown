I'm a third of the way into my Summer Break.

Lately I've been valuing so much more of my free time because of work. 
By free time I mean it's damn hard trying to set a curfew when you want to spend time with your friends.

I went out for Clawshack and Milk tea with my Gish friends, Katie, Sanders, and Michael. 
I haven't spent time with either of them in a long time; it was nice catching up.
And making fun of each other. And stealing my food.

I spent the entire night playing games with my other close friends in the group; Vincent, Victor, and David.
Actually, I've been playing with them every other night since Summer. 

There are a bunch of discounted games coming out this week that I want to play with the guys;
The sad thing is I have the money to afford everything but I don't have the time for anything. 

Life is moving by fast. Please slow down. 
Unless I'm at work, you can speed that back up.
