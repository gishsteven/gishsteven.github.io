I've been hosting a few get togethers at my place this Summer. 

The first one was because I was cooking crab and I invited my friends over.
The second one was just yesterday, for Independence Day fireworks. 

I usually never offer up my place for my friends to come over;
It's been really nice, I have the backyard and lighting for it. 



Also, a week ago I recieved this email from 'past me' 

"Hello World,

Today you had to withdraw 60% of your savings because your car's transmission only allows you to drive in reverse.

You are a year away from graduation with already maxed out loans and debt crawling up your credit cards.

You are worried about your parents financial situation as well.

Reality slapped us hard today.

If we won the lottery today the first thing we would do is pay off all my debt, my parents, and the house itself. Nothing comes to mind atter those wishes.

By the time you get this message; it should be summer and you should be free to work full time.

This is a reminder that you have others to take care of, especially yourself."
