My summer has been an equilibrium of turnout of events. Depsite all that has happened so far, it was a pleasant Summer. A busy one.
Summer goals; I bit off more than I could chew. The fact that I was able to experience everything, though not all the way, was well worth it at least. I had a shift in priorities without realizing it; and I've spend more time in some place more than I should have. 

I want to start off with simpler goals. 
I also want an expensive tattoo. 
And a high end customized computer. 
I want to get into calligraphy, really get into calligraphy. 
I want to be more focused. 
Particularly this year, I'd like to focus on a few set things in life.
