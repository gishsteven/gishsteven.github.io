The project scope explores sophisticated actuation in myriapod robots utilizing the dsPIC33F microcontroller. Myriapods are creatures characterized by their segmented bodies and a multitude of limbs. These features provide a level of complexity in terms of flexibility and movement not commonly found in biped or quadruped counterparts. This allows a peculiar advantage in mobility and other areas in tandem with all-terrain movement.
Problem descriptions in this field involve research and development to explore suitable applications of this design in the field of robotics and locomotion. Such applications to explore are the known applications commonly found in myriapods that are not found in biped or quadruped animals. These applications include the ability to fine-tune motor control to achieve uniform maneuverability, actuation, and versatility in the field of all-terrain environments.
The scope of technology used will revolve primarily around the dsPIC33FJ128MC802 Microchip as the platform. Utilizing the microchip in a master-slave association will manage the actuation of the robot by controlling each micro servo using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals. Connections between serial peripheral interface (SPI) ports and the myriapod robot will be configured through the software programmed to the microchips. Use of a gyroscope and infrared distance sensor will aide in guiding direction of the robot. Software integrations involve the use of MPLAB® X IDE v3.61 and MPLAB® XC16 compiler to serve as the programming and compiling interface of the microchips.
