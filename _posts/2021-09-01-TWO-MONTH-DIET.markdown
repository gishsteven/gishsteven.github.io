On September 15th, 2021, I entered an online Body Composition Contest.
https://www.fittrace.com/contest-2021/

The contest awards participants for the best body composition improvements within an eight (8) to ten (10) week period. 
Contestants can win either by amount of fat mass lost or lean mass gained. 


Why am I doing this?
I like competition. I enjoy challenging myself.
I want to see how I perform.
I want to see where this takes me. 

For my diet of choice I'll be following a ketogenic diet I found in Tools of Titans. 
Here's I'll be tracking my progress on a weekly basis. I'll track my calories and activities throughout my eight (8) week journey. 

Cheers!
