On September 15th, 2021, I entered an online Body Composition Contest.
https://www.fittrace.com/contest-2021/

The contest awards participants for the best body composition improvements within an eight (8) to ten (10) week period.
Contestants can win either by amount of fat mass lost or lean mass gained - this is measured by Dexascan. 


Why am I doing this?
I like competition. I enjoy challenging myself.
I want to see how I perform.
I want to see where this takes me. 

For my diet of choice I'll be following a ketogenic diet I found in Tools of Titans (Chapter on Dominic Dâ€™Agostino). 
Here's I'll be tracking my progress on a weekly basis. I'll track my calories and activities throughout my eight (8) week journey. 

Cheers!

09/06/2021: Transition to Low-Carb Diet
Weight: 145lbs
I wanted to slowly start my transition towards the ketogeneic diet before the contest started.
The next to weeks going forward, I transitioned to a low carb diet with a high emphasis on fat. 
I had a tablespoon of coconut oil, avocodo oil, and/or extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) with my coffee every morning.

I downloaded MyFitnessPal to keep track of my calories - I found a lot of enjoyment in this, especially the barcode scanning feature. 

I spent a lot of my hours doing research on diet and supplementing. I heavily referred back to the resources provided in Tool of Titans. I started following a youtube channel by Thomas DeLauer. I'm always open to new information, most of the content I've read so far regarding ketosis has been contradicting from one source to another. The best I can really do is test things out myself, and take what I learn with a grain of salt. 

09/15/2021: Initial Dexascan
Weight: 141lbs
I had my dexascan appointment today. Results? I make up of 23% body fat - most of it residing in my Trunk and Legs. 
Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR): 1572 cal/day
Total Body Fat: 23.8%
Total Mass (lbs): 141.2lbs
Fat Tissue (lbs): 33.6lbs
Lean Tissue (lbs): 101.9lbs

The two weeks up until this test - the only side effects I felt during my transition was that I had to pee a lot. I kept carbs to a minimum, in social dinners where carb was unaviodable, I had extremely small servings. That scallion bread I had on Tuesday? I allowed myself one bite and watched my girlfriend devour the rest. 

I used a glucose monitor to test my Blood Ketone Levels later that night.
Blood Ketone Level: 0.7 mmol/L https://ketobm.com/blogs/ketogenic-resources/results
I didn't even start my fasting yet but it looks like I did really well on my transition to keto.
0.7 mmol/L is what I was expecting to get after Day 1 of fasting. 

09/17/2021: Fasting - Day 1
I started my three (3) day fast last night after dinner. (I played some volleyball afterwards from 9pm-11pm as well, I want to say this attributed to my fast)
I'm following instructions from Tim Ferris - 
I'm allowed up to 300-400g of fat per day in the form of MCT powder and coconut oil.
I also supplment with exogenous ketones (KetoCaNa) and some trace amounts of BCAA to start my day. 
The only thing I didn't do was a three-four hour brisk walk in the morning because I had work. 
I was already at 0.7mmol. I took a twenty minute walk during my lunch break.

I had work today and my energy levels dropped in waves. There was a period of hunger pains during lunch and some hours throughout the day.
Hot water, salt, and MCT oil kept me going throughout the day. 

I had a hard time falling asleep at night - I felt so physically weak and I experienced some migranes. 
I cheated on my diet somewhat and had my girlfriend give me a half her pinky's size of block cheese to nibble on.
That cheese tasted like the best thing I've ever had in my life. I had a very tiny portion of cheese but I managed to savor that like a three course meal.

09/18/2021: Fasting - Day 2
I felt A LOT better when I woke up this morning. I allowed myself to sleep as late as possible. I took my blood test around lunch time.
Blood Ketone Levels: 4.4 mmol/L
This put my ketone production at "Starvation or Fasting Ketosis".
I cheated today and had five small scallops from the lunch I cooked for her. Bad idea to cook for someone whilst you yourself are trying to fast...

2:00PM Check-In: I have a hint of a headache today but had no hunger panes so far. Thank you scallops.

09/09/2021: Fasting - Day 3
