On September 15th, 2021, I entered an online Body Composition Contest.
https://www.fittrace.com/contest-2021/

The contest awards participants for the best body composition improvements within an eight (8) to ten (10) week period.
Contestants can win either by amount of fat mass lost or lean mass gained - this is measured by Dexascan. 


Why am I doing this?
I like competition. I enjoy challenging myself.
I want to see how I perform.
I want to see where this takes me. 

For my diet of choice I'll be following a ketogenic diet I found in Tools of Titans (Chapter on Dominic Dâ€™Agostino). 
Here's I'll be tracking my progress on a weekly basis. I'll track my calories and activities throughout my eight (8) week journey. 

Cheers!

I wanted to slowly start my transition towards the ketogeneic diet before the contest started.
The next to weeks going forward, I transitioned to a low carb diet with a high emphasis on fat. 
I had a tablespoon of coconut oil, avocodo oil, and/or extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) with my coffee every morning.

I spent a lot of my hours doing research on diet and supplementing. I heavily referred back to the resources provided in Tool of Titans. I started following a youtube channel by Thomas DeLauer. I'm always open to new information, most of the content I've read so far regarding ketosis has been contradicting from one source to another. The best I can really do is test things out myself, and take what I learn with a grain of salt.
